----------
Most samples are compact and contained in a single file. In this case, they must
have an informational comment on top of the file (or after the line with the
opening tag such as <?php or #!shebang) to facilitate automatic aggregation of
samples into the Cookbook (https://go.soletude.ca/stagsi/cookbook) and elsewhere:

  [prefix] `! lic=cc0`, con=[Name]<[proto:]your@contact>`, rev=$Id$ [`,+ suffix]

Vimmers may recognize it's a kind of modeline. It allows arbitrary trailing text
(suffix) in addition to arbitrary prefix.

lic indicates the content's license (always CC0 in this repository).

con stands for "contact" and can be as simple as <example@soletude.ca> where
the default proto: (protocol) is mailto:.

rev is a stand-in for the commit hash (man gitattributes, ident).

Sample info lines for C:

  // `! lic=cc0`, con=Young Xi<https://insane.org>`, rev=$Id$
  /* `! lic=cc0`, con=Young Xi<https://insane.org>`, rev=$Id$`, +*/

If your sample needs multiple files then allocate a subdirectory in any of
the existing directories (e.g. in Tools) with a README.txt inside which has
the info line on top. Having it in other files is optional (but it won't hurt).
