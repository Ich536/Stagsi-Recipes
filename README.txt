Stagsi Community Samples
========================

This repository contains useful bits of sample code, mostly in form of simple
scripts and plugins to either Stagsi or third-party programs like VLC or FCEUX.

  Stagsi is an advanced (file) tagging system:

No guarantees are made about this code's quality or it workability at all.
In general, it's meant for advanced users who are not shy of editing a few
variables in a plain text file.

  Editing is done best with Notepad 2e, a lightweight but powerful text editor:
